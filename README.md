demo_project
============

Basic Django demo application

I used this application as part of a test task for an undergraduate research position
working on Genome Engineering software. The first project we want the undergraduate to work
on was helping us deploy an existing bit of software to Amazon. This repository serves as a
nice basic piece of code that a reasonably qualified candidate should be able to work with
and modify to demonstrate basic coding/admin proficiency.
